### homework
My daughter is called Jane. She never dreamed of receiving a letter. The letter was from a girl. She is of her own age. She lives in Holland. Last year, we were traveling across the Channel. Jane wrote her name and address on a piece of paper. She put it into a bottle. She threw the bottle into the sea. She never thought of it again. Ten months later, she received a letter. It came from a girl. She was in Holland. Both girls write to each other regularly now. They have decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more. Letters will certainly travel faster.
