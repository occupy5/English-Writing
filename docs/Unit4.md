Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I live near an airport. I can hear the passing planes night and day. They built airport years ago. For some reason they could not use it then. Last year, they used it later. The noise must drive people away. Over a hundred of them have left from their homes. Few people did not move. I am one of them. A passing plane will knock down this house. Sometimes I think so. They offered a large sum of money to me. They wanted me to go away. I am determined to stay here. I must be mad. Everybody says so. They are probably right.
