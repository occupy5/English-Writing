### homework
I had an experience last year. It was amusing. I had left a small village. It was in the south of France. I drove on to the next town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped. He asked me for a lift. He had got into the car. I said good morning to him. I used French. He replied. He used French too. I only know a few words. I do not know any French at all. He and I did not speak during the journey. I had nearly reached the town. The young man suddenly said, "do you speak English?' His speaking was very slow. I soon learnt. He was English himself!
