We have an old musical instrument. It is called a clavichord. It was made in Germany. It was made in 1681. We keep our clavichord in the living room. Our family has it for a long time. My grandfather bought the instrument many years ago. Recently a visitor damaged it. She tried to play jazz on it! She struck the keys too hard. She broke two of the strings. My father was shocked. Now he does not allow us to touch it. A friend of my father's is repairing it now.

[^2]: 可以改成 (which is called)Topsail,括号部分可以省略，Topsail直接做同位语
[^3]: then不是一个连接词，因此前面加上and来连接整个句子
[^4]: 用across the Atlantic这个介词短语来修饰名词
